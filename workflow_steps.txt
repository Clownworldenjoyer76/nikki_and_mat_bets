10. Odds / Weekly Data Fetcher

(from earlier setup)
	‚Ä¢	When it runs: Automatically on Tuesday at 6 AM EST, or manually.
	‚Ä¢	What it does: Pulls the NFL games for the upcoming week (spreads + totals) from the API and saves them into:
docs/data/weekly/<season>_wkNN_odds.csv
docs/data/weekly/latest.csv
	‚Ä¢	Why: Provides the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù line set for that week. This is the base file used for both picks and scores.

2. Save Picks From Issue (Manual)

File: .github/workflows/save_picks_manual.yml
	‚Ä¢	When it runs: Manually triggered. You enter an issue number.
	‚Ä¢	What it does:
	1.	Fetches the body of that GitHub Issue.
	2.	Parses the JSON (the picks you or Nikki submitted).
	3.	Joins those picks with the week‚Äôs odds (docs/data/weekly/latest.csv).
	4.	Writes results to:
docs/data/picks/<season>_wkNN_picks.csv
docs/data/picks/latest.csv
docs/data/picks/history.csv
‚Ä¢	Why: Captures and stores both players‚Äô picks in structured CSV form. history.csv accumulates season-long picks.

3. Init Scores CSV (Manual)

File: .github/workflows/init_scores_manual.yml
	‚Ä¢	When it runs: Manually triggered (no inputs needed).
	‚Ä¢	What it does:
	1.	Reads docs/data/weekly/latest.csv (CONSENSUS rows).
	2.	Extracts game_id, home_team, and away_team.
	3.	Creates an empty scores sheet for that week with blank columns for home_score and away_score:
docs/data/scores/<season>_wkNN_scores.csv
‚Ä¢	Why: Gives you a ready-to-fill template for recording final scores after games are played.

4. Combine Picks & Scores (Manual)

File: .github/workflows/combine_manual.yml
	‚Ä¢	When it runs: Manually triggered. You enter the week number (1‚Äì18).
	‚Ä¢	What it does:
	1.	Finds the week‚Äôs picks file (docs/data/picks/<season>_wkNN_picks.csv).
	2.	Finds the week‚Äôs scores file (docs/data/scores/<season>_wkNN_scores.csv).
	3.	Joins them on game_id.
	4.	Outputs the merged file to:
docs/data/final/<season>_wkNN_final.csv
including all picks, spreads, totals, and now the final scores.
	‚Ä¢	Why: Produces the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù authoritative record for the week ‚Äî who picked what, the lines, the results.

5. Build Insights Metrics (Manual)

File: .github/workflows/build_metrics_manual.yml
	‚Ä¢	When it runs: Manually triggered (optional ‚Äúseason‚Äù input; if blank, auto-detect latest season from filenames).
	‚Ä¢	What it does:
	1.	Scans all docs/data/final/<season>_wkNN_final.csv files.
	2.	Computes season-to-date splits (per-team ATS when picked, per-team ATS when faded, home/away ATS, totals over/under, etc.).
	3.	Writes aggregated CSVs to:
docs/data/metrics/team_ats_by_picker.csv
docs/data/metrics/team_fade_ats_by_picker.csv
docs/data/metrics/home_away_ats_by_picker.csv
docs/data/metrics/totals_by_picker.csv
	‚Ä¢	Why: Powers the Insights page (insights.html) with granular records without reprocessing in the browser.
